# FT Tech Test

## Test Instructions

Build a server-rendered site that displays an article from The Financial Times. You may use our Developer APIs to achieve this.
Provide a search box for users to search for headlines containing specific words (i.e. searching for "brexit" should return a list of brexit-related headlines).

## Setting up the project

- Run `git clone` this repo
- Run `cd ft-tech-test` to change into the correct directory
- Run `npm install` to install all packages

## Running the app

- Run `npm run-script launch` to change into this project

## To test
- N/A yet

## Points I addressed

### Be responsive
I included the `<meta>` viewport element and set the width to device-width and initial scale to 1 so that the size of the page adjusts well depending on whichever device is using the app.

### Built using Javascript and Node.JS
### Not be reliant of client-side frameworks like Angular or React 
### Uses Origami Components
Included Origami components from the CSS and JS scripts links in my HTML
### Have a similar look and feel as ft.com - https://www.ft.com/
Should use similar Origami components and so have same colour scheme and typography
